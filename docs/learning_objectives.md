This workshop will introduce students to Mobile Robotics using an mobile platform and a collaborative robot arm. The prepared sessions build upon each other towards the ability to perform in situ additive manufacturing with the aim of extending the lifespan of existing building components and including novel architectural or functional features: 

* Students will learn the basic concepts of mobile construction robotics
* Students will learn the basics of sensing and context awareness
* Students will learn specific workflows for extrustion 3d printing
* Students will learn adaptive design-to-fabrication workflows
